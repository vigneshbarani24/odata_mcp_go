# OData MCP Bridge - Service Hints Guide

The OData MCP Bridge includes a flexible hint system to help users work with OData services that have known issues or special requirements. This guide explains how to use and customize the hint system.

## Overview

Service hints provide:
- Known issues and limitations of specific OData services
- Workarounds for common problems
- Field formatting guidance
- Example queries that work correctly
- Implementation notes

Hints are displayed in the `odata_service_info` tool response, making them easily accessible when working with a service.

## Using Hints

### Default Behavior

By default, the bridge looks for a `hints.json` file in the same directory as the binary:

```bash
./odata-mcp https://my-service.com/odata/
```

### Custom Hints File

Use a custom hints file with the `--hints-file` flag:

```bash
./odata-mcp --hints-file /path/to/my-hints.json https://my-service.com/odata/
```

### Command Line Hints

Inject hints directly from the command line:

```bash
# Simple text hint
./odata-mcp --hint "Remember to use \$expand for navigation properties" https://my-service.com/odata/

# JSON hint
./odata-mcp --hint '{"notes":["Custom note"], "workarounds":["Custom workaround"]}' https://my-service.com/odata/
```

### Viewing Hints

Hints appear in the `odata_service_info` tool response:

```json
{
  "service_url": "https://my-service.com/odata/",
  "entity_sets": 10,
  "implementation_hints": {
    "service_type": "SAP OData Service",
    "known_issues": [
      "Some SAP OData services return HTTP 501 Not Implemented for direct entity access"
    ],
    "workarounds": [
      "Use $expand to bypass HTTP 501 errors: Instead of get_PurchaseOrderItem with key '1234567890', use filter_PurchaseOrderSet with $filter=PONumber eq '1234567890' and $expand=PurchaseOrderItemDetails"
    ],
    "hint_source": "Hints file: hints.json"
  }
}
```

## Hint File Format

The `hints.json` file structure:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "hints": [
    {
      "pattern": "*/sap/opu/odata/*",
      "priority": 10,
      "service_type": "SAP OData Service",
      "known_issues": [
        "Issue 1",
        "Issue 2"
      ],
      "workarounds": [
        "Workaround 1",
        "Workaround 2"
      ],
      "notes": [
        "Additional note 1",
        "Additional note 2"
      ],
      "field_hints": {
        "FieldName": {
          "type": "Edm.String",
          "format": "10-digit numeric string",
          "example": "1234567890",
          "description": "Field description",
          "required": true
        }
      },
      "entity_hints": {
        "EntitySet": {
          "description": "Entity description",
          "notes": ["Entity-specific notes"],
          "examples": ["Example queries"]
        }
      },
      "function_hints": {
        "FunctionName": {
          "description": "Function description",
          "parameters": ["param1", "param2"],
          "examples": ["Example calls"]
        }
      },
      "examples": [
        {
          "description": "Get purchase order with details",
          "query": "filter_PurchaseOrderSet with $filter=PONumber eq '1234567890' and $expand=Items",
          "note": "This bypasses HTTP 501 errors"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Field Descriptions

- **pattern**: URL pattern with wildcard support (`*` matches any characters, `?` matches single character)
- **priority**: Higher numbers take precedence when multiple patterns match (default: 0)
- **service_type**: Human-readable service type name
- **known_issues**: Array of known problems with the service
- **workarounds**: Array of solutions to known issues
- **notes**: General notes about the service
- **field_hints**: Field-specific guidance (types, formats, examples)
- **entity_hints**: Entity-specific guidance
- **function_hints**: Function-specific guidance
- **examples**: Complete example queries with explanations

## Pattern Matching

The hint system uses pattern matching to determine which hints apply to a service:

### Wildcard Patterns

- `*` - Matches any sequence of characters
- `?` - Matches exactly one character

### Examples

- `*/sap/opu/odata/*` - Matches all SAP OData services
- `*SRA020_PO_TRACKING_SRV*` - Matches services containing this name
- `https://myserver.com/odata/*` - Matches all services on a specific server
- `*Northwind*` - Matches any service with "Northwind" in the URL

### Priority and Merging

When multiple patterns match a service URL:

1. All matching hints are collected
2. Hints are sorted by priority (higher first)
3. Hints are merged, with higher priority values overriding lower ones
4. Arrays (known_issues, workarounds, notes) are combined
5. Objects (field_hints, entity_hints) are merged with override

## Default Hints

The bridge includes default hints for common services:

### SAP OData Services

Pattern: `*/sap/opu/odata/*`

Provides general guidance for SAP OData services including:
- HTTP 501 workaround using `$expand`
- CSRF token handling
- Date format considerations
- Case-sensitive field names

### SAP PO Tracking Service

Pattern: `*SRA020_PO_TRACKING_SRV*`

Specific hints for the SAP Purchase Order Tracking service:
- Critical workaround for HTTP 501 errors
- PONumber field formatting requirements
- Complete examples using `$expand`

### Northwind Demo

Pattern: `*Northwind*`

Identifies the public Northwind demo service for testing.

## Creating Custom Hints

### Step 1: Identify Issues

Test your OData service and note any issues:
- Error messages
- Formatting requirements
- Required workarounds
- Successful query patterns

### Step 2: Create Hint File

Create a `hints.json` file with your findings:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "hints": [
    {
      "pattern": "*my-service.com/odata/*",
      "priority": 100,
      "service_type": "My Custom Service",
      "known_issues": [
        "Requires specific date format",
        "Case-sensitive field names"
      ],
      "workarounds": [
        "Use ISO 8601 dates: 2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
        "Check $metadata for exact field casing"
      ],
      "field_hints": {
        "CreatedDate": {
          "type": "Edm.DateTime",
          "format": "ISO 8601",
          "example": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 3: Test Your Hints

```bash
# Test with your custom hints
./odata-mcp --hints-file my-hints.json https://my-service.com/odata/

# Verify hints appear in service info
# Call odata_service_info tool in your MCP client
```

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Include concrete examples and exact error messages
2. **Prioritize Workarounds**: Focus on solutions rather than just listing problems
3. **Use Examples**: Provide working query examples
4. **Test Patterns**: Verify your patterns match intended services
5. **Document Fields**: Include field types, formats, and examples
6. **Version Control**: Keep hints files in version control with your projects

## Troubleshooting

### Hints Not Appearing

1. Check file path:
   ```bash
   ./odata-mcp --verbose --hints-file my-hints.json https://service.com/odata/
   ```

2. Verify JSON syntax:
   ```bash
   python -m json.tool < hints.json
   ```

3. Test pattern matching:
   - Ensure your pattern matches the service URL
   - Try broader patterns like `*service.com*`

### Hints Not Merging

- Check priority values (higher priority overrides lower)
- CLI hints always have highest priority (1000)
- Arrays are combined, objects are overridden

## Contributing Hints

If you discover issues with public OData services, consider contributing your hints:

1. Test the service thoroughly
2. Document the issues and workarounds
3. Create a hint entry with clear examples
4. Submit a pull request with your hints

Together we can build a comprehensive knowledge base for OData service quirks and workarounds!
